# Automatic-Water-Dispenser
Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the project description for inclusion in your resume, with each point expanded to demonstrate the technical and practical impact of the work:

---

### 1. **Developed a Smart Contactless Water Dispenser**  
   - Designed and implemented an **Arduino-based automatic water dispensing system** that ensures a hygienic and touch-free user experience.  
   - Integrated an **ultrasonic sensor** to detect the presence of a hand or glass near the tap. When detected, the system automatically activates a servo motor to dispense water.  
   - This system effectively minimizes contamination risks, making it highly suitable for high-traffic areas like schools, offices, and public spaces, especially during health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

### 2. **Technical Expertise in Embedded Systems**  
   - Programmed the **Arduino Uno microcontroller** to process signals from the ultrasonic sensor, calculating the distance to nearby objects and triggering the servo motor for precise tap control.  
   - Utilized **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** for smooth and accurate servo motor operation, ensuring seamless water flow without mechanical delays.  
   - Designed a compact and efficient setup powered via USB, allowing for ease of portability and adaptability in various environments.  
   - Created a reliable and low-maintenance system that addresses real-world issues such as water wastage and hygiene in public utility systems.

### 3. **Enhanced Usability and Sustainability**  
   - Focused on user-friendly features by building a system that is simple to operate and maintain, with practical applications in homes, offices, schools, and hospitals.  
   - Proposed future advancements, including **IoT integration for real-time water usage tracking** and **AI-driven optimizations** to predict usage patterns for better efficiency.  
   - Designed the dispenser to align with sustainability goals, reducing water wastage through precise control mechanisms and proposing options for solar-powered operation to enable off-grid usage in rural areas.  
   - Envisioned multifunctional capabilities to dispense other liquids like sanitizers or soap, enhancing hygiene beyond water dispensing.
